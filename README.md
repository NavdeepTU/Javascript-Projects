This repository contains projects that I have built using html, css and javascript during my training at Publicis Sapient.

The projects are hosted at below links:

1. Form Validator - https://navdeeptu.github.io/Javascript-Projects/form-validator/
2. Movie Seat Booking - https://navdeeptu.github.io/Javascript-Projects/movie-seat-booking/
   In this project the data is stored in localStorage so when the brower is reloaded the UI is populated based on that data
3. Custom Video Player - https://navdeeptu.github.io/Javascript-Projects/custom-video-player/
   The project uses html5 video API and controls the video using plain javascript and css.
4. Exchange Rate Calculator - https://navdeeptu.github.io/Javascript-Projects/exchange-rate-calculator/
   In this project the data based on which all calculations are performed to update the UI is fetched from external API.
