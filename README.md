This repository contains projects that I have built using html, css and javascript during my training at Publicis Sapient.

The projects are hosted at below links:

1. Form Validator - https://navdeeptu.github.io/Javascript-Projects/form-validator/
2. Movie Seat Booking - https://navdeeptu.github.io/Javascript-Projects/movie-seat-booking/
   In this project the data is stored in localStorage so when the brower is reloaded the UI is populated based on that data
